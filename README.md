# AdventOfCode2023
A fun way to learn Go


## Day 5
### Part 1
Started by creating maps that had the calculations of al explicit ranges
This was a valid solution for the test data, but computationlly too heavy for the input data
Created some structs to hold the ranges data and be able to compute the mappings on the fly
